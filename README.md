Examples main mdl files (the files that needs to be run by MCell) are:
- main-I20V80.mdl
- main-I20V100.mdl
- main-I40V80.mdl
- main-I40V100.mdl
- main-20p10hz.mdl

**I20V80** is short for "**I**nterspike interval of **20** ms and **80** **V**DCC" for a paired pulse stimulus.

**20p10hz** is short for "**20** pulses at **10hz** for a train stimulus.

Run these mdl files through terminal (linux) or command prompt (windows) with following command:
```
mcell main-I20V80.mdl
```
